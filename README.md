## How it Works
This app is a planner and expense tracker in one. There are three main parts to this application the first is 'My Year'. This displays the top event for the entire year so you can quickly view big upcomming events for any month. The second part of this application is 'My Month' it display a calender along with a weekly planner for you to store day to day tasks. Lastly, there is 'Expense Tracker', which as the name implies tracks you expenses and alows you the view them easily. In addition there is a 'Reset Planner' button which deletes the data from 'My Year' and 'My Month'. Ideally this is for when a new year is about to begin, but can be used any time.
