## Application Idea
This digital planner will allow you to keep track of all your day to day needs. It will allows you to keep track of what takes you have completed along with what task you still need to do. If i am able to then I will try to add different feature to this planner such as an expense tracker, water intake chart, mood chart. 
 
## Functionality
My application will store the data of all tasks except those deleted. If i am able to add expense tracker, water intake chart, and mood chart then I would like to store the daily data and make it into monthly overview charts that show how you averaged in previous months. The main planner part will probably delete all its data once a month. In addition I would like to be able to set up certain task based of a frequency such as once a week on thurdays complete task x. Also if possible it would be cool to set up a reminder for the tasks you havent completed.
