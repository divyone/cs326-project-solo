## Application Idea
This digital planner will allow you to keep track of all your day to day needs. It will allows you to keep track of what tasks
you have completed along with what task you still need to do. It also has an expense tracker to track how money someone spends.
 
## Functionality
My application will store the data of all tasks except those deleted. It also has an expense tracker that alows the user to store 
and track their spending, this is done through a database. The main planner part will save the data for the entire year and 
have the option to reset it at anytime through a button. It will also have a yearly view which shows the user their top 5 
event for the month they choose.

## Data Interations
-For the yearly view portion, when you click on a month it will display the top 5 events for that month. The user will alse have
the option to edit the events, any edits will be saved to the local storage.

-For the weekly planner portion, there will be any interactive calendar to navigate which week you want to add task to. The
calendar will alway open to the current week and display the days sunday through saturaday. When the user click on a differnt 
week the saved data (if any) will display. The user is able to add different task to each day and check off a task to represnt
its completion.

-For the expense tracker it will save data through the server instead of local storage.
